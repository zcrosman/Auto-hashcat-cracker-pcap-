# Auto-hashcat-cracker-pcap-

WIP!    
  
**TODO**
  implement hashcat rule options  
  menu for choosing which handshake to crack   

Setup:  
  change directory/file variables   
  hashcat-utils folder is moved to the hashcat folder   
  handshakes folder is already set up  
  
  
I find this WPA wordlist to work pretty well
